hv_kvp_daemon - Automaked version

hv_kvp_daemon is a program where it communicates with a Hyper-V parent partition with the system's information such as Network Addresses and anything that the host may wish to share with the guest.

The version included here was copied from the git tree as of Febuarary 17, 2013 and adapted to make it work nicely with automake (such as checking for the presence of hyperv.h). This daemon should build on all systems regardless if it is a Hyper-V guest partition or not.

To install, you can always pull the "./configure; make install" procedure.
